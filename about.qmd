My name is Shuntaro Kawakami (skawakam@hotmail.com) - https://github.com/skawakamNY

The project is on finding out whether if there is any correlation between COVID and flu infection (https://github.com/skawakamNY/covid-flu-infection-correlation).

This project was created as a part of Kaneâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp (https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
